              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>One of the common mistake during cloud migration is not reevaluating the service when changing the business, not matter how easy the process is, when the service is not needed to be used, then you don’t have to use it, without confirming is a big problem when migrating.</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Bad cost handling, paying for more than needed, executing future planning to early, overlooking things that can cost more even though it’s not need, and it can cause a lot of issues if you are not managing it only waiting for the final bill to come at the end of the month, how you tackle this is by having a proper cost handling, only use what is needed for the end user.</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Not evenly distributing responsibility with users, providing the users with too many permissions, it could cost your Aws environment to be vulnerable to problems, causing human errors, security issues and configuration problems, how you prevent is by only having a few admins because not all of the user needs to be, and restricting the access needed for their jobs</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Not giving the end users the proper training and certification needed, it would be easier if the IT staff is speaking a similar language to ensure management of the cloud resources.</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Auto scaling is not being used, using auto scaling helps you to create scaling polices for using resources across different services, auto scaling also provides you with recommendations on what need to optimize performance and cost also making it balance for the two of them.</li>
