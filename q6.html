              Although the cloud provider will monitor the availability and basic health of the system, you should conduct your own monitoring to keep an eye on things from your business perspective. Although you may not need to monitor physical hardware, depending on your cloud service, you still need to monitor your virtual machines, operating system resources, and application availability. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Security is a shared responsibility between your organization and the cloud provider, so you need to control access. Likewise, you must have supervision that focuses on legal and regulatory compliance issues. This is especially important because data protection regulations may require data to be kept in a specific geographic location, and the cloud can easily move data anywhere. 
            </p>
            <p>
              You need to monitor utilization to ensure that all cloud-based machines you pay for are required; it is very easy to start a server for short-term use and forget to shut it down when it is no longer needed. You must also monitor cloud resources and networks to ensure that end users get adequate performance. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, you need special monitoring to verify that your cloud migration has achieved the goals you set for the project, whether you measure this in terms of funding, number of employees, physical footprint, or time to introduce new resources.

             Although the cloud has changed the responsibilities of your IT team, it has not eliminated them. You need to provide training to make sure the team knows what tasks they are still responsible for and how they differ in the cloud. In addition to training their operations team, development teams must also understand how using the cloud can change the way they design, build, test, and deploy applications.

             When it comes to cost optimization, another approach is to refactor applications so that they can benefit from provisioning of resources on demand, such as a "function as a service" architecture, or even stateless applications, where infrastructure can be deployed and deployed. during work Destroyed afterwards. The main cost efficiencies can be found using cloud native technologies and methods. The best part is that due to the nature of the public cloud, this refactoring can be done independently and can be fully tested in parallel. Small, manageable improvements can be made over time to achieve these efficiencies, and this work should be part of your ongoing application improvement process.

          <h2>Security</h2>
        </div>
             <p>
             During the coexistence phase of the migration, the security policy must allow traffic and system access between the applications in the two environments. These policies should be reviewed immediately after the "legacy" end of the application is decommissioned. may tend to wait until all legacy applications are retired, but doing so will introduce security risks during migration. Although this can be a tedious process, any security breach will eventually consume more time, so it is best to fix it as soon as possible. The security review should not be limited to legacy workloads. Cloud platform security is very different from traditional platforms, and migration provides the opportunity to review available features and use them whenever possible
