             When a company decides to shift the local architecture into the cloud-first, we will have to prepare themselves for that migration what old data we need what is exactly the application we are going to push into the cloud how it should work how the security measures should be made how the business should run after that what are the products, we are going to move to the cloud that we have to plan the business and the migration according to our own business so we will have to plan all of that and keep it aside so after preparing how to do it and what and all should be used to do it.

            This step what we are going to do is we will plan for the uncovered stuff which  created in the business planning and migration preparation so we would have discussed what has to be done what environment has to be launched how the architecture should look so we would have planned all of these business use cases so in portfolio discovering and planning what exactly happens is we will test the readiness for migrating it the readiness in the sense to migrate an application into the cloud all of the required essential software's and the environments the instances the virtual machines the databases all of them should be created and if it is needed, we should be connected according to the plan which was created first and also the business should be made that it uses the cloud processes all over after that it should not use on-premise setup because they are going to move to the cloud you will also have to set up a secure a turbulence account which our entire company's software's and applications are hosted on all of this happens in this stage and also we'll have to discuss what migration strategy we are going to use while migrating the application.

             This step all the applications will be designed and also after they get designed, they'll have to be designed in application level so that they can go be launched on the cloud if our organization has 10 different applications, they'll have to design the application for how it will suit the cloud if it is a disturber of some kind of a website, we will have to change the code so we have to change the structure in order to launch it to the cloud and also after doing that then we will have to migrate it to the cloud and after migrating it. Also, we will have to check how it works on the cloud if it works fine, we will have to validate it so that is what this step suggests so in this step all of the applications will be taken care of and will be created according to the cloud needs. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After changing the code and all of the stuff which is needed after doing that then we will migrate it and after migrating it then it will be validated after validating all the applications will be on the cloud infrastructure this is the step which comes right after planning because this is one of the important steps and a lot of time goes into this particular process so there will be a lot of time put into creating the application which would be scalable highly available on the cloud and also after that it should be properly migrated and validated.

             <p>
             The operation steps after migrating to the cloud what do we do is, we turn off the legacy systems we cancel that entire architecture. We use the cloud architecture hereafter. So, we will have to create a system that can constantly monitor manage the applications on the cloud instead of on-premise setup. We will have to be constantly trading our application so that it does not go against cloud needs because the cloud is an ever-changing technology it will be kept on changing the software's versions will be different IT. We keep on adding it will be kept on updating so even your application has to be managed and it has to be up to date to the cloud technologies that's what you will have to constantly monitor and maintain it.
